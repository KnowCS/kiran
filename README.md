a1.LOGIC GATES Preparation

In Boolean Algebra there are three basic operations "+,.,'" Which are analogous to disjunction,conjunction,negation in propositional logic.Each operations has Digital logic gate apart from these their are a few logical gates as well

Logic Gates
------------

  1.AND gate(.) - The AND gate gives an output 1,if both the two inputs are 1,its gives 0 otherwise
  2.OR gate(+) - The OR gate gives an output 1,if either of the two inputs are 1,its gives 0 otherwise
